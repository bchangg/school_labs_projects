(1) Write a boolean method called validColumns(File myFile) which returns true if a File object called myFile exists, is a file (not a directory), and has the following format:
	- The first line contains three Strings (titles) separated by commas, and nothing else. For example:
		First Name, Age, Height
	- The following lines *each* contain a String (with no spaces), then an int, then a double, and nothing else. For example:
		Sally 14 163.4
		
(2) Write a boolean method called generateSquares(File nums) which reads the file referenced by File object nums, and creates another file with the filename of nums concatenated with the word "Squared". For example, if the filename of nums is "distances.txt", the generated file should be named "distancesSquared.txt".

You may assume the nums file contains one int per line. For example:
	3
	-8
	12
	2
	3
	-4
	
The generated file should contain the squares of all the numbers in nums, also one per line.
	9
	64
	144
	4
	9
	16
	
generateSquares returns true if everything is successful, and false if the process fails somehow.
